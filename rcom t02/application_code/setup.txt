1. Copy your linklayer.c file and any auxiliary .c files (if any) into the "protocol/" folder.
2. Compile the application and the virtual cable program using the provided Makefile.
3. Run the virtual cable program: ./cable_app
4. Test the protocol
    4.1 Run the receiver: ./application_main /dev/ttyS11 tx penguin-received.gif
    4.2 Run the transmitter: ./application_main /dev/ttyS10 rx penguin.gif
    4.3 Should have received a nice looking penguin
5. Test the protocol with cable unplugging and noise
    5.1. Run receiver and transmitter again
    5.2. Quickly move to the cable program console and press 0 for unplugging the cable, 2 to add noise, and 1 to normal
    5.3. Should have received a nice looking penguin even if the cable disconnected or with noise added
